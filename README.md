# simpsons-paradox
Presenting the Simpson's Paradox on Covid-19 data.

The data come from https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=simpsons_paradox_covid. They consist of three binary variables: outcome (survived, death), age_group (under 50, 50+), and vaccine_status (vacccinated, unvaccinated).

The src folder contains a Python script.

ntbk.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook file that also shows the outcomes of the code.

Required packages and their versions can be found in requirements.txt.
